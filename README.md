# D.S-Assignment-1
# Linked List Team Project – <TeamName>

## 📌 Overview
This repository is part of **CO3 – Data Structures Lab (S3, INMCA2024-29)**.  
It demonstrates:
- Implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in C.
- **Collaborative development** using GitHub (branches, commits, pull requests).
- **Visualization** of linked list operations using Figma diagrams.
- **Team collaboration & reporting**.

---

## 🖥️ Singly Linked List Program
The program creates a linked list where:
- The first node stores the **creator's roll number**.
- Other nodes store the **team members’ roll numbers**.
- Traversal displays the linked list in order.

### Code File
➡️ [`code/linked_list.c`](code/linked_list.c)

### Sample Output



*(Replace 101, 102, 103 with your actual roll numbers)*

## 🔀 GitHub Collaboration
- **Repository Name:** `linked-list-team-<teamName>`
- **Workflow:**
  1. Each teammate created a branch using their roll number.
  2. Contributed small features (insertion, display, comments).
  3. Opened a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge into `main`.
  4. Resolved merge conflicts collaboratively.

✨ Reflection

Working on this project gave us valuable insights into both technical and collaborative aspects of software development. We gained practical experience in building and manipulating linked lists, which strengthened our understanding of dynamic data structures. Using GitHub taught us the importance of version control, branching, and resolving merge conflicts, which are crucial skills for real-world teamwork. Creating Figma diagrams helped us visualize the structure and flow of the program, making abstract concepts easier to grasp. Most importantly, we learned how effective communication and shared responsibility lead to smoother project execution.
